Mobile video players have different limitations as compared to the HTML5 or Flash based implementations
offered through the IMA SDK for web. The most prominent testing tool (link:
https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/vastinspector) works great for doing
testing for integrations that work with the web, but doesnâ€™t offer a solution for testing native mobile apps.
The Mobile Video Suite Inspector helps account managers as well as publisher AdOps to diagnose
and pre flight mobile video implementations by executing the ads directly on a mobile device.
